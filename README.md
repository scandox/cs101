# Basic Hashtable Library in C

An attempt to teach myself a bit of basic CS after a lifetime of just hacking things together and always wanting to learn C since I was 9 doing BASIC and I asked my teacher to help me learn C and they kind went all shifty. Part 1.

```
gcc test.c dantest.c -o test
./test
```

You ought to compile and run this. You may learn something to your advantage.
